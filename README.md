# YelpCamp

This was my first full-stack application! This took me about 2 months to build and taught me a lot about how JavaScript works in tandem with HTML and CSS.
I used bootstrap to simplify a lot of the css features, express.js to create backend endpoints, and implemented a basic non-relational database using
MongoDB and Mongoose.js. User authentication was implemented using a third-party package, passport.js; Joi was used for basic schema validation. I also 
learned CLI commands to install node packages and project dependencies. Let me know what you think!
