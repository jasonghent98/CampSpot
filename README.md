This took me about 2 1/2 months to build. I pulled from a lot of different technologies to this project for a range of features, including geomapping to locate campsites, local strategy for user auth with passport.js API; joi was used for basic schema validation to ensure accurate data was being persisted to data store. Middleware was used in a lot of my controllers to automate data flow and improve scalability. I used bootstrap to simplify a lot of the styling and EJS for the markup.
